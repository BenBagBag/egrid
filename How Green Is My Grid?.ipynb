    "## The Problem of Dirty Electricity\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate scientists predict that we need to have net zero carbon emissions by [YEAR] in order to avoid the global warming \"tipping point\" of [BAD THING]. The shift away from using fossil fuels to power cars, stoves, and so on is a critical and readily visible part of this effort. However, moving from fossil fuels to electric power can't help us achieve net zero emissions unless electricity production itself has net zero emissions. Many of our power plants use CO2-emitting sources such as coal and natural gas to produce electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of CO2-heavy electricity production will only grow. The US is estimated to [increase its electricity consumption](https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/how-will-our-electricity-supply-change-future) by 50% by 2036 and will double by 2050. If we continue to use coal and fossil fuels to produce electricity, our CO2 emissions will be *increasing* at a time when the planet's future depends on our ability to *reduce* emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "[[why focus on co2]]\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How much electricity did these plants produce in 2021? How much power would we expect to need from them by 2036 and 2050?\n",
    "- Which power plants are working at lowest capacity? I.e., which power plants would be able to produce more power as our demand for energy increases? \n",
    "- What will the overall impact of increased demand for electricity be in terms of pollution?\n",
    "- What percent of these are using \"clean\" (or almost clean) power? Which ones are using power sources that contribute to global warming?\n",
    "- Are there particular power companies/states producing power with a lower emissions rate that could serve as models for cleaner power production?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) releases the [eGrid report](https://www.epa.gov/egrid) each year. This report contains data on each of the 11K power plants in the US and Puerto Rico, including power sources, pollution, and efficiency. It also contains a summary of demographic information for the area surrounding each power plant. The most recent data is from 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full description of all terms and data in the dataset can be found in [this guide](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-01/eGRID2021_technical_guide.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal regulations require power plants to report their emissions and energy use. This is the data that is presented in the eGrid report. The EPA describes the dataset as containing information on \"almost all electric power generated in the United States\". It's not clear which power plants would be exempt from this reporting rule and what impact that missing data might have on analysis of the dataset. However, eGrid is used throughout the US government and in industry to calculate the environmental impact of power production, so we will follow the consensus that the dataset is representative of the entire country's power production."

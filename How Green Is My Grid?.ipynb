    "# How Green is My Grid?\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Problem of Dirty Electricity\n",
    "\n",
    "Climate scientists predict that we need to have net zero carbon emissions by 2050 in order to avoid the worst effects of global warming [\"tipping point\"](https://www.un.org/en/climatechange/net-zero-coalition#:~:text=To%20keep%20global%20warming%20to,reach%20net%20zero%20by%202050.). The shift away from using fossil fuels to power cars, stoves, and so on is a critical and readily visible part of this effort. However, moving from fossil fuels to electric power can't help us achieve net zero emissions unless electricity production itself has net zero emissions. Many of our power plants use CO2-emitting sources such as coal and natural gas to produce electricity. \n",
    "\n",
    "The problem of CO2-heavy electricity production will only grow. The US is estimated to [increase its electricity consumption](https://www.nationalgrid.com/stories/energy-explained/how-will-our-electricity-supply-change-future) by 50% by 2036 and will double by 2050. If we continue to use coal and fossil fuels to produce electricity, our CO2 emissions will be *increasing* at a time when the planet's future depends on our ability to *reduce* emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A note on terminology: The terms \"clean energy\", \"green energy\", and \"renewable energy\" are often used interchangeably. [\"Green energy\"](https://www.twi-global.com/technical-knowledge/faqs/what-is-green-energy), in theory, does not produce carbon emissions. However, as we will see, some \"green\" electricity sources, like hydropower, do create carbon emissions. To avoid confusion, we will refer to fuels that produce CO2. We will also discuss fossil/non-fossil fuels, since fossil fuels are generally understood as a pollution source, while non-fossil fuels are erroneously imagined to be emission-free. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Worst fuels\n",
    "- Which fuels are the biggest contributors to carbon emissions from power plants?\n",
    "- Which fuel(s), if eliminated from the US power grid, would have the largest impact on CO2 emissions?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Increased demand for electricity\n",
    "- What percent of power plants are currently using fossil fuels? What percent of power plants use only non-fossil fuels?\n",
    "- How much electricity did these plants produce in 2021? How much power would we expect to need from them by 2036 and 2050?\n",
    "- Do we have extra capacity in the power grid? I.e., which power plants would be able to produce more power as our demand for energy increases, without any changes to the plants themselves?\n",
    "- What will the overall impact of increased demand for electricity be in terms of pollution?\n",
    "- What would the impact of increased demand be if we removed all fossil fuels from the power grid?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Source\n",
    "\n",
    "The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) releases the [eGrid report](https://www.epa.gov/egrid) each year. This report contains data on each of the 11K power plants in the US and Puerto Rico, including power sources, pollution, and efficiency. It also contains a summary of demographic information for the area surrounding each power plant. The most recent data is from 2021.\n",
    "\n",
    "A full description of all terms and data in the dataset can be found in [this guide](https://www.epa.gov/system/files/documents/2023-01/eGRID2021_technical_guide.pdf).\n",
    "\n",
    "Federal regulations require power plants to report their emissions and energy use. This is the data that is presented in the eGrid report. The EPA describes the dataset as containing information on \"almost all electric power generated in the United States\". It's not clear which power plants would be exempt from this reporting rule and what impact that missing data might have on analysis of the dataset. However, eGrid is used throughout the US government and in industry to calculate the environmental impact of power production, so we will follow the consensus that the dataset is representative of the entire country's power production."

The ratio of CO2 emissions : power production (in MWh of electricity) shows us the environmental impact of different fuels. (As a point of comparison, one MWh of electricity can power [two fridges for a year](https://www.freeingenergy.com/what-is-a-megawatt-hour-of-electricity-and-what-can-you-do-with-it/)).\n",

This is in keeping with the debate over whether or not geothermal power is really \"green\"; it produces much more CO2 than other green fuels in addition to the water and air pollution."

    "A note on gas and coal: when natural gas is burned in modern, fuel-efficient power plants, it produces about [50% less CO2 than coal](https://www.gasvessel.eu/news/natural-gas-vs-coal-impact-on-the-environment/#:~:text=Natural%20gas%20is%20a%20fossil,a%20typical%20new%20coal%20plant.). However, our data shows **coal** producing 50% less CO2 than gas. This is likely because our data represents actual power plants in the US and, which are not necessarily using the most efficient power production methods. This suggests two important points:\n",
    "1. Switching gas power plants to more efficient power production methods could be a relatively easy way to reduce emissions from gas. Further research is needed to determine if this is practical, and it doesn't obviate the need to eliminate gas from the power grid.\n",

    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "If the US is to reduce carbon emissions from power plants, the number one priority must be to **eliminate gas-fueled power plants**. Gas produces 94% of the carbon emissions from power production despite accounting for only 41% of power production. Every reduction in gas-produced electricity will pay off more than twice over in carbon emissions reductions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Because gas-fueled power plants account for a plurality of power produced in the US, eliminating gas (and other fossil fuels) from the power grid must be paired with **investing in a power grid driven by non-fossil fuels**. With electricity demand expected to double within the next 30 years, increasing zero-carbon power production is critical to meeting demand while also reaching net zero emissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, moving away from fossil fuels and using more non-fossil fuels is not enough to move the US to net zero emissions from electricity. Fuels such as geothermal and nuclear energy, while producing miniscule emissions levels in comparison to gas, oil, and coal, still emit CO2 into our atmosphere. Without technological improvements to make these fuel sources carbon-free, we will continue to create carbon emissions from electricity production and will be unable to reach net zero emissions by 2050."

    "## Ideas for future investigation:\n",
    "    \n",
    "- How many power plants will we need to build to move off of fossil fuels while meeting increased electricity demand?\n",
    "- Can any of our fossil fuel power plants be converted into non-fossil fuel plants?\n",
    "- Are there particular power companies/states producing power with a lower emissions rate that could serve as models for lower- or zero-carbon power production?\n",
    "- How much extra electricity could we generate from our existing grid, whether through less downtime or improvements to generators? \n",
    "- How will changing climate impact what sort of fuels we can use and where power plants can be built? For example. as water becomes more scarce, how viable will hydroelectric plants be?\n",
    "- How much electricity is generated by solar/wind/geothermal generators attached to individual buildings? Is it practical to use a \"personal power plant\" system to power buildings?\n",
    "- Nuclear power is already a well-established part of our electric grid, producing nearly 1/5 of US electricity. What safety and/or political concerns exist around expanding our use of nuclear power?"
